/* pOH = 4.17, pH = 9.83

Suppose that the pH of a urine sample was measured at 5.53. Calculate the pOH, [H3O+]  and [OH-].  

pOH = 14 - 5.53 = 8.47

[H3O+] = 10^-5.53
[OH-] = 10^-8.47

INDICATORS

weak acids, colours

range, sudden, complete

/* 3.0 ACID DISSOCIATION

completion, equilibrium

dissociates, 100%, do not fully dissociate

K = [Ch3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]

Ka is the acid dissociation constant

ka = [A-][H+]/[HA]

strength of an acid, stronger, infinity and is undefined

Calculate the pH of a 0.100 M ethanoic acid solution. Ka = 1.76 x 10^-5

    CH3COOH <--> CH3COO- + H+

I |    0.100    |   0    |  0
C |      -x     |   +x   | +x
E |   0.100 - x |   x    | x

Ka = [CH3COO-][H+]/[CH3COOH]
   = (x)(x)/(0.100)             <-- Ka * 1000 < 0.100 M
   = x^2 / 0.100
 x = sqrt(Ka * 0.100)
   = 1.33 x 10^-3
   = [H+]

pH = -log[H+]
   = -log(1.33 x 10^-3)
   = 2.877

    HCOOH <--> HCOO- + H+

I |  0.025    |   0  |  0
C |  - x      |  +x  | +x
E |  0.025 -x |  x   | x

         Ka = [HCOO-][H+]/[HCOOH]
            = x^2/(0.025 - x)
1.8 x 10^-4 = x^2/(0.025 - x)
1.8 x 10^-4 (0.025 - x) = x^2
(4.5 x 10^-6) - (1.8 x 10^-4)x = x^2
x^2 + (1.8 x 10^-4)x - (4.5 x 10^-6) = 0

x = 0.0020 = [H+]

pH = -log[H+]
pH = 2.69
